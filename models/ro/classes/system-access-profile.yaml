            A System Access Profile provides a set of System Accesses to be
            allocated to an Employment through a System Access Allocation
          collections:
            mandatory:
              description: >-
                "The 'mandatory' string collection governs the way in which
                specific System Accesses are mandatory, when allocated to an
                Employment through a System Access Allocation. The values
                permitted in each element are:
                  '?': Zero or one
                  '*': Zero or more
                  '+': One or more
                  <n>: a specific number ('0', '1', '2', ...)

                For 'categorized' System Accesses, the name of the category
                collection also acts as a keyword in the 'mandatory'
                collection. For example, the following states that precisely one
                'role' System Access must be allocated:
                  { \"roleAccesses\": \"1\" }

                To state that specific 'generic' System Accesses are mandatory,
                simply reference them by their key in the 'genericAccesses'
                collection:
                  { \"key-of-specific-access\": \"1\" }"
