                The hierarchy category may be used to distinguish hierarchies by
                function instead of having to rely on the ids. E.g., most
                customers have an 'Administrative Hierarchy' used in a variety of
                situations, but the hierarchy ids are different across customers

                This is a collection of types loosely connected to the hierarchy
                without being directly involved in it. This may be used as an
                indication of which objects to prefetch, if building a cache of
                related information
